machine learning to predict the weather?

This is code that was literally thrown together for a short presentation on machine learning using scikit-learn.

1. Download the data in a simple format. `python get_data.py`

2. Flatten and further format the data for use by scikit-learn library. `python flatten_data.py`

3. Run the predictions. `python weatherman.py`

For even more fun, tweak the code to change things like the attributes used as features, or change the classifications from months to seasons.
